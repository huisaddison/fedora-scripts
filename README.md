Scripts for Fedora 23
=====================

These are just some scripts to make my life easier.
 - personal.sh: automates customization and software reinstallation after a Fedora reinstallation
 - flight-cost-monitor.sh: works in conjunction with cron to track airfares of interest (soon to be merged from separate repo)
 - calibre-fetch-news.sh: works in conjunction with anacron to fetch news and magazines.  Based on a [script by rogeliodh](https://gist.github.com/rogeliodh/1560289)
