# flight-cost-monitor
Scripts to monitor flight cost, using the QPX Express API and bash utilities.

Ideally, use this in conjunction with cron to poll the lowest price hourly (or half-hourly -- Google allows you to make 50 requests per day for free) to receive an email when a flight falls within your flight range.
